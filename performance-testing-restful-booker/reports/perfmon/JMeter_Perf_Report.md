### üß† Memory Usage
- **% Committed Bytes In Use:** Indicates the committed virtual memory in use.  
  - **Average:** ~68%
- **Available MBytes:** Represents the physical memory available for allocation.
  - **Average:** ~7932 MB  
  - **Minimum:** 7877 MB  
  - **Maximum:** 7993 MB  

### ‚öôÔ∏è CPU Usage
- **% Processor Time (_Total):** Shows the CPU usage across all cores.  
  - **Average:** ~10.83%  
  - **Peak Usage:** ~88.63%  

## üìà Observations
- The CPU usage spikes intermittently, peaking around 88% during the test.
- Memory availability remains consistent, indicating stable RAM consumption.
- The system handled the JMeter load without significant resource saturation.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion
